DietCalculatorPCL
======================

DietCalculator built for 4 mobile platforms(iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Windows Store Apps) using shareable codebase in Portable Class Libraries.

##About Diet Calculator


DietCalculator is a Silverlight MVC application written few years ago that calcuates daily diet requirements based on few inputs from the user. [Check this blog](http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Exploring-the-Model-View-Controller-MVC-pattern.aspx )


##Port to Mobile 

Many .NET developers working on the Windows platform donâ€™t realize that lots of existing .NET code can easily be ported to all the popular mobile platforms, including iOS and Android. Almost any .NET codebase, including Windows Forms, WPF, ASP.NET, and Silverlight, has sharable code that can be ported to Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android, Windows Phone & Windows Store. 

This project demonstrates the re-use of platform agnostic C# code on all the major platforms.
